The solution involves accessing the props and state after the component has mounted. Here's the corrected code using `componentDidMount()` for class components and `useEffect` hook for functional components.

```javascript
// Correct usage (Class Component)
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null // Initialize state with null or default values
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Access prop after mount
  }

  render() {
    return <View/>;
  }
}

// Correct Usage (Functional Component)
function MyComponent(props) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log(props.someProp); //Access props here
    }, []);

    return (
        <View/>
    )
}
```
By accessing the props and state within `componentDidMount` or `useEffect` (with an empty dependency array), we ensure that the component has fully mounted and received its props before trying to access them.
